	<p>Instead of slow and uncomfortable city busses, we could be using the tube transport “HyperLoop”. We won’t wait for it for a long time, because it will be traveling within 1200km/h. About the amenities, It will be more comfortable, because there are more than 20 self-warming seats in one capsule. Of the fully natural movement, the costs will be cheaper and decreased.</p>	</div>
